  <h1>The Learn Enough Story</h1>

  <p>
    Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach
    <em>technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly magical ability to take
    command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This
    includes everything from command lines and coding to guessing
    keyboard shortcuts, Googling error messages, and knowing when to
    just reboot the darn thing. We believe there are <strong>at least a billion
    people</strong> who can benefit from learning technical sophistication,
    probably more. To join our movement, <a href="http://learnenough.com">sign up for our official
